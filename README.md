# ERISED - Only see what you want to see
### Adblocking using DNS-over-TLS


This is a project with the goal of blocking unwanted ads, trackers, etc across an entire operating system (web and apps). Currently focusing on Android since that's the only major OS with a native DNS-over-TLS implementation.

This group of containers will accept incoming DNS-over-TLS (DoT) requests, pass them through the [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) blocker, and then pass them upstream to an encrypted DNS server.

    Note:
    This currently deploys the Caddy container using a Caddy install using a Personal License. 
    Make sure to change this if you require the commerical license.

## Prerequsistes

Before deploying this you'll need to:

* install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
* install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
* Get a DNS A or AAAA record pointing to your server's IP
* Open port 853 and 80 on your firewall (80 to get a certificate, and 853 for the actual service) 

## Deploying

Once you have all this, clone this repo

`git clone https://github.com/eldridgea/erised.git`

Change into the cloned directory and run the build command replacing "YOUR_HOSTNAME" with your hostname and "YOUR_EMAIL" with your email.

`cd erised`

`docker-compose build --build-arg ERISEDHOST=YOUR_HOSTNAME --build-arg ERISEDEMAIL=YOUR_EMAIL`

Once this is done run 

`docker-compose up -d`

(Or run `docker-compose up` if you want logging output to your terminal)


## Details

This will deploy a stack of three containers:

* cloudflared - to encrypt DNS queries before passing them upstream
* PiHole - to filter out unwanted results
* Caddy - to allow incoming DNS requests to use TLS

A DNS request will look like this:

        ---------
        |Your   |
        |Device |
        |       |
        ---------
            |
            |
            |
            |
        ---------
        |       |
        |Caddy  |
        |       |
        ---------
            |
            |
            |
            |
        ---------
        |       |
        |pihole |
        |       |

            |
            |
            |
        -------------------
        |                 |
        | Cloudflare's    |
        | 1.1.1.1 service |
        -------------------

## Using on Android 9.0 +
DNS-over-TLS is a built in feature on Android 9 (Pie) and later. If used, Android will use that DNS server for all requests on all networks. So this allows for system-wide blocking on all apps and all networks without the need for an always-on VPN.

To use this, open up your Android settings > Network & Internet > Advanced > Private DNS.

Select the "Private DNS provider hostname" option and enter in your hostname that you used for your DNS record and in the build command.
